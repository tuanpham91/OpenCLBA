- Hi everyone welcome to my .. with topic The Needle Detection and Reconstruction Based on OCT image with GPU Acceleration
- First are some infos about the thesis:
- The goal is .. recontruction of the needle with CAD model. 
- An algorithm is developed .. by .. using ICP
- The algorithm was a success, determine the rotation and position correctly
- The only advantage is the execution time, which is ..

Folie 1
- Hi everyone welcome to my .. with topic The Needle Detection and Reconstruction Based on OCT image with GPU Acceleration
- First are some infos about the thesis:
- The goal is .. recontruction of the needle with CAD model. 
- An algorithm is developed .. by .. using ICP
- The algorithm was a success, determine the rotation and position correctly
- The only advantage is the execution time, which is .. for best processor
- Task highly parallelized -> strength of GPU 
- The goal : Implementation with GPU, accelerate the execution time.

Folie 2 - GPU  Programming 

- Some differences:
	+ More threads available.
	+ Better for highly parallelized tasks : image processing, computer graphics.
	+ Draw back: external libraries are not usable
	+ Require kernel code and extra preparation.
- 2 Implementation :
	+ 2 popular implementations : OPENCL and CUDA
	+ OPENCL For both Vendors.
	+ CUDA for NVIDIA, better optimizedd
	+ In this case we use OpenCL


Folie 3 - OpenCL 

	- Developed by Khronos Group as freeware
	- Crossplatform, parralel programming for diverse processors, not only GPU
	- Using C++ kernel language
	- Able to utilize multiple device in a programm
	- Standardized Definition between devices

Folie 4 Host and Device:
	
- Simple presentation of Host and Device Model
- Connected via PCI Express
- Host create assigment for device, prepare input data
- Read and write memory from and to device.
- Each
Folie 5 : Memory

- Important part of OpenCL
- There are some different types of memory
- private : available  for work unit.. local..
- accesss speed :
- size :

Folie 6 Work flow:
- For each input data set there will be 4 iterations
- In each iterations the same process is repeated.
- After each Iteration there will be an update.
